# Datascience Training preparations to have the session:

#### System requirements:

Operation Systems: Windows (7, 8, 10), Linux Ubuntu, Mint
(A regular notebook should work in most cases)

#### Install Jupyter:

Local installation of Python 3.6 and the Jupyter environment

1. Download the Anaconda Python distribution, choose Python version 3.6: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. Follow the installation instructions: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
3. Start a jupyter notebook server either by running 'jupyter notebook' in your terminal or by using the Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/
5. The jupyter server creates a new window in your browser
6. Use the test.ipynb notebook to test your environment
7. Work with your own notebooks...

#### Check out or download this repository

You are almost finished. What is left is to check out or download this repository.
Please note that you should check it out into your document folder (allowance to write and easy to find in jupiter).

# Congratiolations your preperations are finished!


# Datascience Training


#### 01 TODO: Why do we need the three imports ?
		 Find it out yourself, or ask the instructor. 
		 Be Aware the these import could be replaced with a lot of other doing the same.



#### 	02 TODO: Load the dataset
		for breast cancer located in the repository, into your python file.
		 Pandas is delivering the functionality for this task.



####	03 TODO: Check the Dataset
		is everythin ok ? Is something missing? 
		If yes please add the missing information to the dataset you will find all information here:
		https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer/



#### 	04 TODO: Generate csv with corrected Data
		Python does not really have a reliable in memory.
		 To be sure that we do not loose information, let us export the corrected dataset with a suitable name.



####	05 TODO: Generate an exel from the Data to offer this to 'non developer'.
		We can not be sure that our data are always readed by an developer, 
		 so lets generate a exel file out of our dataset as well.



####	06 TODO: Get first entries for our data:
		so lets have a look what our data look like and lets print the first 5 entries.



####	07 TODO: Get an first overview about the Data:
		We would like to know the base values for our data.
		 Lets look how there shape is and how they are described (commands allmost the same) and print them out.



####	08 TODO: matplotlib: 
		We have to konfigure matplotlib to be sure to get later what we would like to have.



#### 	 09 TODO: First Figure:
		 Now we will do a first figure: please implement a bar diagram of the age distribution of all patients.
		 Do not forget that we will also need a suitable description for x and y.



####	 10 TODO: Shaping datasets for plotting it: 
		Most of the data are strings, this wont work for plotting.
		 So think about changing the data in a way we can use to plot them. 
		 Change the type of age and tumor-size.	(Advice use a scatterplot for this task)	



####	 11 TODO: Shaping datasets for plotting it:
		 If you finished TODO 10 you have the tools now to produce any other figures.
		 Produce this figures and try to find as much abnormalities as possible. You can use all kinds of different plots.
